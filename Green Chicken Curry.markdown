Title: Green Chicken Curry

# Ingredients

- 1 whole chicken breast
- 2 chicken thighs
- ½ cup coconut cream
- ¼ cup Green Curry Paste
- 3 cups coconut milk
- 1½ cups diced eggplant (1-inch dice)
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon palm sugar or brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 12 fresh wild lime leaves
- ½ cup horapah basil leaves or other fresh basil leaves
- 3 fresh red chee fah chilies, sliced on the diagonal into ovals about ½ inch thick, or 9 long, thin sweet red pepper strips

# Preparation

Bone and skin the chicken breast and thighs. You should have about 1 pound of meat. Cut the meat into large, bite-sized pieces; set aside.

In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, warm the coconut cream over medium heat until it boils gently. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle boil and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. The coconut cream will become fragrant as it thickens. When you see tiny pools of oil glistening on the surface, add the curry paste and stir to dissolve it into the coconut cream. Continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes, until the curry paste has a pleasing aroma.

Add the chicken pieces and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes to coat them evenly with the paste. Cook for about 2 minutes. Increase the heat and add the coconut milk, eggplant, fish sauce, sugar, and salt; stir well. Stir in 6 of the lime leaves, adjust the heat to maintain a gentle, active boil and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust the seasoning with a little more fish sauce, sugar, or curry paste.

When the chicken is done and the eggplant is just tender, remove from the heat and transfer to a serving bowl. Scatter the basil leaves, chilies, and the remaining 6 lime leaves on top and serve hot or warm. 

# Notes

SERVES 6.

Green curries take their name from the fierce, green kii noo chilies that are the base of the curry paste. It’s a wonderful blend and my favorite Thai curry.

Kanome jeen, a soft, white rice noodle folded into little nests and sold in every Thai market, is a popular accompaniment to green curry. You can serve it with any type of cooked noodles, however. Prepare the noodles, place them in individual serving bowls while the curry heats, and add the curry just before serving. Steamed rice is also a good accompaniment.

To cook the curry in advance, prepare it up to the point where it has been cooked with the lime leaves, except do not add the eggplant. Cool to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. To serve, bring the curry back to a gentle boil over medium heat. Add the eggplant and proceed as directed.

Thais use the golfball-sized eggplants called makeua poh, often labeled Thai eggplants in Asian stores here. If you use this type, stem and quarter them lengthwise instead of dicing them. They may need a little more time to become tender than other types of eggplant. Thai cooks also add a handful of makeua peuang, a tiny eggplant that grows in clusters and resembles a large, hard green pea. There’s no substitute, but the curry is still delicious without them.

If you can find neither the red chilies nor the sweet red pepper, omit them.

Chicken is used in the classic green curry, but Thais like it with beef as well. I like to make green curry with shrimp or seafood and snow peas instead of eggplant, adding them both at the end when the curry is done and cooking them just until they are tender.
