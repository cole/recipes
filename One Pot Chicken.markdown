# Ingredients

- 1.75-2kg (4lb-4lb 8oz) chicken
- 6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
- 6 thyme sprigs
- 2 large leeks
- 2 small turnips
- ½ small swede (rutabaga)
- 4 medium carrots, peeled, trimmed and quartered lengthways
- 1 small onion, trimmed leaving root intact, then quartered
- 8 small (golf-ball-sized) red-skinned potatoes
- 75ml (2¼fl oz) rapeseed oil
- 50g (2oz) unsalted butter, room temperature
- Optionally, add sliced limes/lemons or bay leaves

# Preparation

Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and leave to stand for 1½ to 2 hours, or until it comes up to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 240°C/475°F/gas mark 9.

Using a paring knife cut out the wishbone from the chicken (making it easier to carve). Generously season the cavity, add three of the garlic cloves and five sprigs of thyme, then massage the inside to infuse it with the flavours. Truss the chicken.

Cut off the dark green leaves from the top of the leeks. Trim off and discard any darkened outer layers. Trim the root end, cutting around it on a 45-degree angle. Slit the leeks lengthways almost in half, starting 1cm (½in) above the root end. Rinse well under running water.

Peel the turnips and cut each into eight wedges.

Peel the swede and cut it into wedges to match the size of the turnip.
Combine all the vegetables and the remaining garlic and thyme in a large bowl. Toss with three quarters of the oil and season. Spread out the vegetables in a large cast-iron frying-pan or roasting-tin.

Rub the remaining oil all over the chicken and season generously. Make a nest in the centre of the vegetables and nestle the chicken in it. Cut the butter into four or five pieces and rub into the breast. Put the pan in the oven and roast for 25 minutes. Reduce the heat to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6 and roast for an additional 45 minutes, or until the juices run clear. If necessary, return the bird to the oven for more roasting, checking it every five minutes.

Transfer the chicken to a carving board and let it rest for 20 minutes. Just before serving, set the pan of vegetables over a medium heat and reheat, turning the vegetables and glazing them with the pan juices.

Cut the chicken into serving pieces, arrange over the vegetables, and serve.
