# Ingredients

- 1 cup cream
- 2 ounces butter, cut into a few chunks
- salt to taste
- freshly and finely ground black pepper to taste
- 4 to 6 swipes of a nutmeg across a microplane, or to taste
- 12 ounces fresh pasta*
- 2 ounces finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (1 to 1 1/3 cups)

*Note: If you want to make your own pasta use the 3:2 pasta ratio: 9 ounces flour, 6 ounces egg (two scant cups flour, three large eggs).  Mix it all together and kneed it till it’s smooth, let it rest, covered 20 minutes or so before rolling it and running it through the fettuccini cutter.

# Preperation

The fact is, the excellence of Alfredo sauce is all but totally reliant on the quality of the cheese.  It’s not worth making with anything less than Reggiano.

Other important points are the use of fresh pasta—dried pasta is simply too heavy for the elegant sauce.  So either make your own or buy it fresh.  Finally, judicious seasoning, salt, freshly ground black pepper, and just enough nutmeg to taste.  As for timing and degree of difficulty, the hardest part of this dish is waiting for the pasta water to boil.

Put a pot of water on to boil.  Bring the cream to a simmer in a pan large enough to toss the pasta in.  Turn the flame to medium low, add a chunk of butter and whisk or swirl it into the cream.  Add the remaining butter and whisk or swirl continuously until the butter is incorporated into the cream. Turn the flame off or remove it from the heat, give it a solid three-fingered pinch of salt, several grinds of pepper, and the nutmeg, then cover.

Stare at the pot of water on the stove and tap your foot to let it know you’re waiting.  (Or set the table.  Or toss the salad.  Or pour a glass of wine.)

Cook the pasta till it’s al dente, a couple of minutes.  Drain it, and slide it immediately into the cream.  Toss it gently, then sprinkle three-quarters of the cheese over it and toss till the cheese has melted and the sauce evenly coats the pasta.  Serve, topped with a little more Reggiano.  (If you overdo it with the cheese or you accidentally over-reduced your cream, and the sauce has become thick—the sauce should fit like comfortably loose clothing—you can thin it with a little warm milk.)

This is decadently rich, so serve four rather than two.
